<p>Project Stockholm Royal Seaport is collaboration of Stockholm Stad and our visualization group, the aim of this programme is to provide straightforward visuals for the data of this construction region, including construction status, substainability, transport convenience, etc. The database is provided by Stockhold Stad, and our main challenge is find the right approach to make them explicable and intuitive.</p>

<p>Our teammate Sabina created a site to better illustrate this project, here is the <a href="http://sabinavonessen.me/royalseaport/">link to the site</a>;</p>

<p>However, you could still get a preview of this project by try it yourself.</p>

<p>The sunburst diagram enables you to click on any entity and see the detail of it, and by clicking the center of the diagram you could go back to upper hierachy.</p>
