<p>Weird-o-Compiler is the outcome of the course Compiler Theory which I took in my third year of bachelor’s education. The work is collaborated with Yehang Yin, a reliable and respectable friend of mine. We also take the Numerical Analysis course together.</p>

<h2 id="what-woc-supports-and-what-not">What WoC Supports and what not?</h2>

<p>WoC is a C-like and Javasricpt-like compiler with weird restrictions</p>

<p>Supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>functions, nested functions</li>
  <li>all loop kinds of C, break &amp; continue</li>
  <li>branching (if &amp; else)</li>
  <li>label and goto</li>
  <li>variable</li>
  <li>all logical and numerical operations of C</li>
</ul>

<p>Not supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No MACRO</li>
  <li>No struct &amp; union</li>
  <li>No pointers</li>
  <li>No dynamic strong types (but have built-in types)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-function-of-woc">What is the function of WoC?</h2>

<p>You could imagine WoC as something like GCC (ROFL), it can</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compile codes writen in WoC syntax, to intermediate representation / Assembly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Help you locate errors in your WoC program</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a visualization of IR tree for your code</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-work-with-it">How to work with it?</h2>

<p>To test and use this project, you should</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Build the project on your platform (Linux 64-bit suggested),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a piece of code as if you are programming in C, but be careful with the rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the following command to <strong>Compile with WoC</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

Options:
        -a      Generating AST in JSON
        -i      Generating IR tree in JSON
        -s      Generating symbol table for scopes in JSON

<h2 id="what-did-we-use-to-create-woc">What did we use to create WoC?</h2>

<p>The tools are introduced and learnt via the labs of this course, basically, <strong>Bison and YAML</strong>. We design our tokens, and rules to interpret statements, then make use of these tools to complete the first several steps to build a compiler. As for the construction of IR tree, the re-coding to assembly, and the visualization of the tree, these are totally carried out on our own.</p>

<h3 id="side-notes">Side Notes</h3>

<p>You might wonder where the name of this project comes from, actually, we just thought the syntax we designed is kind of weird, so we would like to name it Weird Compiler, however then we realize the abbreviation of it is not supposed to be WC anyway, so we add an emoji like “<strong>-o-</strong>” between the words, which at the same time represents our emotions developing such a compiler, yarning in the midnights – it seems not a easy task to do with anyway. Then Eventually, the compiler is call WoC.</p>
