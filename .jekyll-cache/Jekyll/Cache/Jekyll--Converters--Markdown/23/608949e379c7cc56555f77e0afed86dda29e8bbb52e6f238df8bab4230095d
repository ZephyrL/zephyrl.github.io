<p>This project is using an offline SDF baker (SDFr), and maintaining global distance field at runtime.
Current shadowing functions run at about 120 fps, while I guess it would be more suitable for generally static scenes, which means that you’d better to use it for things that seldom change or move, to avoid efficiency problems.</p>

<p>There are some slides with videos to illustrate the project better (in the Github repository), originally it was not written in English and was converted by google translate, please check it you’d like to. Anyway, you could get a preview of the result from the following screenshots.</p>

<h2 id="whats-it-about">What’s it about?</h2>

<p>The work of this project is originally completed through an internship at NetEase Inc., it includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research on the use of S DistanceField Field</li>
  <li>Unity implementation: Offline baking of local SDF smodels</li>
  <li>Unity implementation: Global SDF for real-time maintenance, global Distance Field</li>
  <li>Unity implementation: GDF-based real-time soft shadows and ambient occlusion rendering</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-a-signed-distance-field-sdf">What is a signed distance field (SDF)?</h2>

<p>Distance field is a form of mapping in 2D/3D space: from any point <em>p</em>,  mapping to the distance <em>d</em> to the nearest boundary (2D) or plane (3D) in the space.</p>

<p>Distance fields have many categories, SDF is one of them, which is characterized by distinguishing the inner and outer properties of the grid, with a positive distance outside the grid and a negative one inside.</p>
