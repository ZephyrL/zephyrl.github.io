<a href="https://github.com/ZephyrL/DFAO-unity">[Link]</a> to this project on Github.</p>

<p>This project is using an offline SDF baker (SDFr), and maintaining global distance field at runtime.
Current shadowing functions run at about 120 fps, while I guess it would be more suitable for generally static scenes, which means that you’d better to use it for things that seldom change or move, to avoid efficiency problems.</p>

<p>There are some slides with videos to illustrate the project better, originally it was not in English and was converted by google translate, please check it you’d like to. Anyway, you could get a preview of the result from the following screenshots.</p>
