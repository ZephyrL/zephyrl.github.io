<p>This project is a Unity-based game application which was finally deployed on Android smartphones, it is also my first try of using Unity.</p>

<p>I’m also glad to introduce that the project is completed by me and my kind teammates, Linghao CHEN and Yuxin LIAO, who always accompanied me through my bachelor’s education.</p>

<p>The game is called <strong>ISORunner</strong>, name given by Linghao; he explains that “ISO” is a diminutive used in basketball denoting a 1v1 or 1 vs N game, so we just call this one ISO-Runner, as it is a single-player, and the mode of games matches exactly to the definition of ISO.</p>

<p>ISORunner includes two game modes, one is a running game, in which you should control the boy to run though all the obstacles. The other modes is like the Game of Bombs, that you should drop bombs on tiles, and eliminate waves of enemies.</p>

<p>If you are reading this and don’t want to be bored by the upcoming long description of our project work, I would suggest you to directly try the game instead, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WspZE7MGQffC2-u6AbFyx2m7B0xhYcXw">using the link to the installer of game on Android.</a> To successfully run the game, we suggest you to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android smartphone with <strong>Minimum Version Android4.4</strong> supported.</li>
  <li>At lease <strong>1GB</strong> RAM</li>
  <li>Screen aspect ratio <strong>16:9</strong> for best gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Noted that we no longer maintain or update this game, since we completed this project long time ago and now we are graduated. If you would like to report a bug or see the source of this game, please feel free to <a href="mailto:zhy@kth.se">contact me</a>, and I’ll reply as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="previews-of-the-game">Previews of the game</h2>

<h3 id="game-mode-running-game">Game Mode: Running Game</h3>
<p><img src="/images/isorunner/preview-1.png" alt="img" />
To make the game more fun to play, we introduced various obstacles and bonus elements, the player is not only controlled by moving and jumping, but also have to surmount different obstructions by doing specific operations. You might see that sometimes you have to wait for a while to get over the roadblock,</p>

<p><img src="/images/isorunner/preview-4.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>And sometimes the road is invisible, and don’t worry, we provide you with a functions to through stones to check a solid path, if the stone hits the ground you could hear a sound (which is recorded in reality where a stone drops), then by steping on the right tile you could see the update in the minimap on the top-right corner, which means you gradually find your way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/isorunner/preview-3.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>We also create chances for you to collect bonus and improve your score. By collecting coins like a Super Mario you would hit higher place on the Rankings board, in case you would like to challenge your friend and see who could achieve a higher score.</p>

<p><img src="/images/isorunner/preview-2.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>And there is actually a place where you could check your previous scores, both available in running mode and the battle mode.

<h3 id="game-mode-bombs-game">Game mode: Bombs Game</h3>

<p>In battle mode you play mainly with bombs, draw damage to enemies and see how many waves of enemies you could finally defeat. At the beginning you could drop one bomb at a time, but no worries, you would have ways to level yourself up – by runes! There are totally five kind of runes which would periodically exist at a random position in the map, go collect it, and you would be empowered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/isorunner/preview-7.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>By collecting the runes, you could become faster, stronger(knock enemies out of map), or remove the limitation of number of bombs in a short time, whatever, you would get to know the benefits any rune could give you when you take it. Also, you might get tired of the small bombs sometime, so we give you a chance to use a huge powerful bomb everytime you get another kilo scores.</p>

<p>There are actuall more content that we could cover here to should you how the game runs, while we still insist you to have a try if possible.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>All that introduced above pertains to the our gameplay designing task, while it is just one of the many task that we have experienced from developing a game. Besides gameplay, we get to know about <strong>art design, scene management, game logic, soundtrack handling, database management</strong> and a lot more.</p>

<p>As you see that, many of the textures used in the game are made by ourselves, moreover, the switching among menu and scenes, the animation state machine that handles the static-running-jumping state of a character, and the read and load of a permenant database which stores the scores – We would say that we learn much from these, and the experience really helps me spot some blind point which I didn’t realize for developing a game.</p>
