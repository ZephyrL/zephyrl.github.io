<p>This project is a Unity-based game application which was finally deployed on Android smartphones, it is also my first try of using Unity.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also glad to introduce that the project is completed by me and my kind teammates, Linghao CHEN and Yuxin LIAO, who always accompanied me through my bachelor‚Äôs education.</p>

<p>The game is called <em>ISORunner</em>, name given by Linghao; he explains that ‚ÄúISO‚Äù is a diminutive used in basketball denoting a single player game, so we just call this one ISO-Runner, as it is single-player, and a parkour-like game basically.</p>
