<p>This project is a Unity-based game application which was finally deployed on Android smartphones, it is also my first try of using Unity.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also glad to introduce that the project is completed by me and my kind teammates, Linghao CHEN and Yuxin LIAO, who always accompanied me through my bachelor‚Äôs education.</p>

<p>The game is called <strong>ISORunner</strong>, name given by Linghao; he explains that ‚ÄúISO‚Äù is a diminutive used in basketball denoting a 1v1 or 1 vs N game, so we just call this one ISO-Runner, as it is a single-player, and the mode of games matches exactly to the definition of ISO.</p>

<p>ISORunner includes two game modes, one is a running game, in which you should control the boy to run though all the obstacles. The other modes is like the Game of Bombs, that you should drop bombs on tiles, and eliminate waves of enemies.</p>

<p>If you are reading this and don‚Äôt want to be bored by the upcoming long description of our project work, I would suggest you to directly try the game instead, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WspZE7MGQffC2-u6AbFyx2m7B0xhYcXw">using the link to the installer of game on Android.</a> To successfully run the game, we suggest you to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android smartphone with <strong>Minimum Version Android4.4</strong> supported.</li>
  <li>At lease <strong>1GB</strong> RAM</li>
  <li>Screen aspect ratio <strong>16:9</strong> for best gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Noted that we no longer maintain or update this game, since we completed this project long time ago and now we are graduated. If you would like to report a bug or see the source of this game, please feel free to <a href="mailto:zhy@kth.se">contact me</a>, and I‚Äôll reply as soon as possible.</p>

To make the game more fun to play, we introduced various obstacles and bonus elements, the player is not only controlled by moving and jumping, but also have to surmount different obstructions by doing specific operations. You might see that sometimes you have to wait for a while to get over the roadblock,</p>

<p>And sometimes the road is invisible, and don‚Äôt worry, we provide you with a functions to through stones to check a solid path, if the stone hits the ground you could hear a sound (which is recorded in reality where a stone drops), then by steping on the right tile you could see the update in the minimap on the top-right corner, which means you gradually find your way.</p>

<p>We also create chances for you to collect bonus and improve your score. By collecting coins like a Super Mario you would hit higher place on the Rankings board, in case you would like to challenge your friend and see who could achieve a higher score.</p>

<p>And there is actually a place where you could check your previous scores, both in running mode and the battle mode
