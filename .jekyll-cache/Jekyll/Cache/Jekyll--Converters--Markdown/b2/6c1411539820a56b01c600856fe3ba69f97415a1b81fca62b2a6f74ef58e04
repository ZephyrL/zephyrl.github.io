<p>Project Stockholm Royal Seaport is collaboration of Stockholm Stad and our visualization group, the aim of this programme is to provide straightforward visuals for the data of this construction region, including construction status, substainability, transport convenience, etc. The database is provided by Stockhold Stad, and our main challenge is find the right approach to make them explicable and intuitive.</p>

<p>Our teammate Sabina created a site to better illustrate this project, here is the <a href="">link to the site</a>;</p>
