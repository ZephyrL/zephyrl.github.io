<p>This project is a Unity-based game application which was finally deployed on Android smartphones, it is also my first try of using Unity.</p>

<p>I’m also glad to introduce that the project is completed by me and my kind teammates, Linghao CHEN and Yuxin LIAO, who always accompanied me through my bachelor’s education.</p>

<p>The game is called <em>ISORunner</em>, name given by Linghao; he explains that “ISO” is a diminutive used in basketball denoting a solo game, so we just call this one ISO-Runner, as it is single-player, and a parkour-like game basically.</p>

<p>ISORunner includes two game modes, one is a parkour game, in which you should control the boy to run though all the obstacles. The other modes is like the Game of Bombs, that you should drop bombs on tiles, and eliminate waves of enemies.</p>
