A Weird Compiler and It‚Äôs visualization</p>

<h3 id="side-notes">Side Notes</h3>

<p>You might wonder where the name of this project comes from, actually, we just thought the syntax we designed is kind of weird, so we would like to name it Weird Compiler, however then we realize the abbreviation of it is not supposed to be WC anyway, so we add an emoji like ‚Äú<strong>-o-</strong>‚Äù between the words, which at the same time represents our emotions developing such a compiler, yarning in the midnights ‚Äì it seems not a easy task to do with anyway. Then Eventually, the compiler is call WoC.</p>
